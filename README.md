# Arabic Named Entity Recognition

This project is made to enrich the Arabic Named Entity Recognition(ANER). Arabic is a tough language to deal with and has alot of difficulties.
We managed to made a model based on Arabert to support 50 entities.Also we support Franco(translitrated Arabic) so the user can type in Franco or Arabic or mix between them.
we deployed our model as website so that users can interact with it easily. Also we integrated Camel model in our website.
